data = ["Another nice partnership building up for India here. England once again looked clueless like the tours they have been on before on how to pick wickets. Stokes might consider bringing in Wood for a spell here. Also, the fact that they have gone in with three spinners they have shot themselves in the foot. The spinners they have picked might have the potential to become good in the future but as of now, they are very undercooked. Going forward in the series Ben Stokes needs to consider different combinations. As we update Hartley picks Shubman Gill."]
